# arm64emu — an AArch64 system emulator (pure interpreter)

A from-scratch **ARMv8-A (AArch64) system emulator** written in C11 with **no
external dependencies** (libc/POSIX only). It is a **pure interpreter** — no JIT,
no dynamic translation. It runs the **real EDK2 `ArmVirtQemu` UEFI firmware** and
**boots Linux to a userspace shell**, with the **serial console on your terminal**.

The emulated platform is the QEMU `virt` machine (GICv2), the standard,
well-documented target for EDK2 and Linux on AArch64.

## What it does

- Loads and runs the **actual** `/usr/share/qemu-efi-aarch64/QEMU_EFI.fd`
  firmware and runs it through SEC/PEI/DXE/BDS to the **UEFI Interactive Shell**
  (`Shell>`), including the 5→1s boot-countdown driven by the generic timer.
- **Boots a Linux kernel** supplied over fw_cfg: the EDK2 EFI-stub decompresses
  the kernel, exits boot services, and Linux comes up — detecting the CPU, GICv2,
  generic timer, PL011 console, PL031 RTC, PSCI and the PCIe host bridge — then
  mounts the initramfs and runs **`/init` in userspace (EL0)**, reaching an
  interactive **BusyBox shell**.

```sh
make                       # builds ./arm64emu  (C11, libc only)
make test                  # runs the assembly self-tests

# Boot the EDK2 firmware to the UEFI shell (serial -> your terminal):
./arm64emu -bios /usr/share/qemu-efi-aarch64/QEMU_EFI.fd

# Boot Linux via fw_cfg (the EDK2 -kernel path, no disk needed):
./arm64emu -bios /usr/share/qemu-efi-aarch64/QEMU_EFI.fd \
           -kernel Image -initrd initramfs \
           -append "console=ttyAMA0 earlycon=pl011,0x9000000"

# Share host directories into the guest over virtio-9p (repeatable):
./arm64emu -bios .../QEMU_EFI.fd -kernel Image -initrd initramfs \
           -virtfs /path/to/project,tag=proj \
           -virtfs /srv/data,tag=data,ro

# virtio-console on hvc0, so the guest terminal size tracks the host window:
./arm64emu -bios .../QEMU_EFI.fd -kernel Image -initrd initramfs \
           -console virtio \
           -append "console=hvc0 earlycon=pl011,0x9000000"
```

Useful flags: `-m <MB>` RAM size, `-dtb FILE` supply a device tree,
`-drive IMG[,ro]` attach a virtio-blk disk (repeatable; `ro` opens the image
read-only and advertises VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO), `-net` user-mode networking
(`-netfwd tcp|udp:HOST_PORT:GUEST_PORT` forwards host ports to the guest),
`-virtfs DIR[,tag=TAG][,ro]` share a host directory over virtio-9p
(repeatable), `-console pl011|virtio` pick the console device (default `pl011`),
`-bin FILE@ADDR` load a flat binary (bare-metal tests), `-d`
per-instruction trace, `-rt` register trace, `-maxinsn N` stop after N
instructions.

**Host directory sharing (`-virtfs`).** Each `-virtfs DIR` exports a host
directory to the guest as a 9P2000.L filesystem on its own virtio-mmio slot.
`tag=` names the mount (default: the directory's basename); `ro` makes it
read-only (default is read-write, changes pass straight through to the host).
Repeat `-virtfs` for multiple independent shares. Mount inside the guest with:

```sh
mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L proj /mnt/proj
```

The guest kernel needs 9p-over-virtio support (`CONFIG_NET_9P`,
`CONFIG_NET_9P_VIRTIO`, `CONFIG_9P_FS`, plus `virtio_mmio`) built in or as
loadable modules. `..` is confined to the share root; symlinks inside a share
are followed by the host, so a share is a convenience, not a security boundary.

**Console (`-console pl011|virtio`).** The default `pl011` is the PL011 UART
(`ttyAMA0`): a byte-pipe serial line, unchanged and fully deterministic.
`-console virtio` additionally attaches a **virtio-console** on its own
virtio-mmio slot, exposed to the guest as `hvc0`. It advertises
`VIRTIO_CONSOLE_F_SIZE`, so the guest terminal size follows the host window
automatically — the initial columns/rows and every later host resize (SIGWINCH)
are propagated, and full-screen programs (`vi`, `less`, `top`) redraw without a
manual `resize`. The guest kernel needs `CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE` (with
`CONFIG_HVC_DRIVER`) built in or in the initramfs.

For the resize feature to reach your shell, the guest's **interactive console must
be `hvc0`** — i.e. the kernel must boot with `console=hvc0`. There are two host
consoles sharing one terminal (the PL011 for firmware/GRUB/`earlycon`, and hvc0
for the OS), so host keystrokes are routed to **whichever console last produced
output** ("input follows output"): firmware and GRUB menus stay on the PL011, and
once the guest writes its console to hvc0 your typing (and the window size) follow
there. This means `-console virtio` never leaves you unable to type, wherever the
guest's login ends up.

Getting the login onto hvc0 depends on how you boot:

- **`-kernel` path**: the emulator adds `console=hvc0` to the kernel cmdline for you
  when `-console virtio` is set, so the login lands on hvc0 with no extra flags
  (keep `earlycon=pl011,0x9000000` for early output before the driver probes). This
  works for a guest that has its own root filesystem (an installed disk image, or a
  kernel+initramfs that mounts a real root).
- **`-drive` ISO / GRUB boot** (e.g. the stock Alpine live ISO): the kernel cmdline
  comes from the ISO's bootloader, not from `-append`, and the emulator can't
  override a `console=` baked into it. The Alpine ISO uses
  `console=tty0 console=ttyAMA0`, so its login is on `ttyAMA0` — you can still type
  (input follows it). To move the login to hvc0, edit the GRUB entry at the menu:
  press `e`, go to the `linux` line, and **append** ` console=hvc0` at the end
  (last `console=` wins), then `Ctrl-X` to boot. Keep the existing
  `console=ttyAMA0` — *append*, don't replace it: the live ISO's boot-media
  discovery relies on it, and dropping it makes early init fail (`switch_root:
  can't execute '/sbin/init'`). For the same reason, booting a live ISO's kernel
  directly via `-kernel` won't work — its root overlay is assembled only under its
  own GRUB boot. (An installed system with a normal root filesystem has neither
  restriction: just use the `-kernel` path, where `console=hvc0` is auto-added.)

Note that host resize events make `virtio` mode as non-deterministic as any
keyboard input; the default `pl011` path is untouched.

Debug/bring-up env vars (all off by default, no runtime cost when unset):
`AEDBG=N` device/IRQ + fw_cfg/flash logging, `AEPROF=1` hot-PC profiler,
`AERING=1` recent-instruction ring buffer, `AETPC=0xADDR` dump CPU state at a PC,
`AEWATCH=0xADDR` watch writes to an address, `AEIABORT=1` log instruction aborts,
`AECOV=file` coverage-divergence finder (see below).

### What is implemented

- **Integer ISA**: data-processing (immediate & register), shifts/bitfields,
  conditional select/compare, mul/div/madd/smulh/umulh, rev/rbit/clz/cls,
  **CRC32/CRC32C**, branches, the full load/store family incl. LDP/STP,
  pre/post/unscaled/register-offset, **STTR/LDTR** (unprivileged),
  **STNP/LDNP** (non-temporal pair), exclusives and acquire/release.
- **System level**: EL0/EL1, MSR/MRS with a large system-register file, ID
  registers matched to QEMU's cortex-a57, MMU (48-bit VA, 4 KB granule, blocks &
  pages, AP/XN/AF) with a software TLB and an instruction-fetch fast path,
  exception entry/return, SVC/HVC/SMC/BRK, barriers/CLREX/WFI/WFE, TLBI, DC ZVA.
- **FP/SIMD**: scalar floating-point (convert int↔fp, FMOV, FADD/FSUB/FMUL/FDIV,
  FABS/FNEG/FSQRT, FCMP/FCCMP, FCSEL, FCVT, FRINT, FMADD/FMSUB/FNMADD/FNMSUB);
  Advanced-SIMD load/store multiple structures (LD1–LD4/ST1–ST4), modified
  immediate (MOVI/MVNI/…), copy (DUP/INS/UMOV/SMOV), three-same vector integer
  (ADD/SUB/logical/compare/min-max/MUL/ADDP), across-lanes reductions
  (ADDV/UMAXV/UMINV/…), two-register misc (NOT/NEG/ABS/CNT/compare-with-zero),
  and shift-by-immediate (SHL/SSHR/USHR/SSHLL/USHLL).
- **Platform devices**: GICv2, generic timer (periodic IRQs), PL011 serial,
  PL031 RTC, PSCI (HVC/SMC), fw_cfg (data port + DMA, legacy kernel keys),
  **Intel CFI (pflash_cfi01) NOR flash** so EDK2's UEFI variable store works,
  and empty virtio-mmio / PCIe / GICv2m / GPIO transports so probing behaves.

## Differential testing against QEMU (development only)

QEMU is used purely as a *development oracle* — never linked or required to run
`arm64emu`. Two techniques made deep bring-up tractable:

1. **Same-run DTB + coverage.** Boot the same firmware in QEMU, dump its runtime
   device tree from guest memory, and capture `-d in_asm` coverage from the *same
   run* (so the DTB, including its random seed, matches). Reconstruct the full
   set of executed instruction addresses from the `OBJD-T` bytes.
2. **Coverage-divergence finder** (`AECOV=qemu_cov.txt`): run `arm64emu` with the
   identical DTB and stop at the first PC it executes that QEMU never does — i.e.
   the exact point where control flow first leaves QEMU's path. This pinpointed
   each bug (a missing device register, a wrong DTB node, an unimplemented
   instruction) instead of debugging a silent hang.

This located, among others: the virtio-mmio magic value, a too-small device
tree (missing the `cfi-flash`/PCIe/virtio nodes), the CFI flash command set, and
an exception-return bug (instruction-abort ELR pointing at the wrong PC).

## Current state and remaining work

- **Firmware**: boots SEC→PEI→DXE→BDS to the **UEFI Interactive Shell**, with a
  working CFI-flash variable store.
- **Linux**: the EFI-stub kernel boots to **userspace** — kernel init completes,
  `/init` runs, and a **BusyBox shell** is reached over the serial console.
- **Remaining work**: a small tail of Advanced-SIMD opcodes is still grown on
  demand (the kernel/musl exercise more NEON than the firmware); a subtle
  correctness issue can surface deep in a complex init script. Interpreter
  **performance** is ~40 MIPS, so a full distro boot is slow (see *Performance
  notes* below for why a decoded-instruction cache did **not** help).
- **Devices**: **virtio-blk** (`-drive`, disk-backed rootfs), **virtio-net**
  (`-net`, user-mode NAT via the built-in usernet stack in `src/net/`: DHCP,
  DNS redirect, TCP/UDP proxying and `-netfwd` port forwarding over plain
  host sockets — IPv4 only, no TAP/TUN, no external libraries), **virtio-9p**
  (`-virtfs`, host directory sharing), and **virtio-console** (`-console
  virtio`, host-tracking `hvc0` terminal size) are implemented over
  virtio-mmio, alongside the fw_cfg initramfs rootfs.

These are incremental extensions along the path already established. The hard
parts — a correct CPU/MMU/exception core, the device model, the CFI flash and
firmware↔platform contract (DTB, fw_cfg, PSCI), and the full firmware→kernel→
userspace hand-off — are done and validated against QEMU.

## Performance notes

The interpreter runs at **~40 MIPS** (firmware boot prefix, `-O2`, single core).
A pure interpreter spends its time on the per-instruction work itself — fetch,
operand extraction, the ALU/memory operation — not on classifying the opcode.

### JIT (`-jit`, off by default)

An opt-in basic-block JIT (ported from the arm64chroot sibling project)
translates guest code to host x86-64 (an AArch64 backend is included but
untested on hardware): **~350 MIPS (≈9.5×)** on the Linux-boot workload,
>99.8% of instructions native in steady state. The interpreter stays the
default and the reference — `make test-jit` requires byte-identical CPU
state between the modes on deterministic boots. Design, full-system
coherence (SMC store-tracking, block/context keying, IRQ safepoints) and
debug knobs: [docs/jit.md](docs/jit.md).

### Decoded-instruction cache — evaluated, not adopted

A **decoded-instruction cache** (the classic "memoize the decode" interpreter
optimization, *not* a JIT) was implemented and benchmarked, then reverted. It was
a direct-mapped table keyed by PC that cached the resolved group-handler function
pointer for each instruction word, re-validated against the live word on every
hit (so it stayed correct for self-modifying / decompressed code with no flush).

It was **correct** — full CPU state stayed byte-for-byte identical to the plain
interpreter over 50M firmware instructions, at a ~99.99% hit rate — but it **did
not improve throughput; it was ~5–6% slower**. Findings, kept here so the
experiment isn't blindly repeated:

- This decode tree is **shallow and branch-predictable** (a 4-bit top-level
  `switch`, then short per-group chains). The classification a cache hit skips is
  only a handful of correctly-predicted branches — cheaper than what the cache
  adds: an **indirect call** through the cached pointer (mispredicts) plus the
  **data-cache pressure** of a ~1 MB table.
- At ~90 cycles/instruction the hot loop is extremely sensitive: merely *defining*
  the function-pointer classifier inside `decode.c` (taking the handlers'
  addresses) perturbed that translation unit's codegen by ~6%, even when the cache
  was disabled.
- The real lever for a pure interpreter is **operand pre-decode** — caching a
  fully decoded form (opcode id + pre-extracted operands) dispatched via a dense
  `switch`, so a hit skips operand extraction too, not just classification. That,
  or accepting the current speed, is the path forward; a function-pointer decode
  cache is not.
